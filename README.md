## Features

### Enderman Shearing

Cut the Enderman's ~~balls~~ enderpearls off.

Using shears on an Enderman disables its ability to teleport,
useful for making them pets or something horrible, like waterboarding them.

Restore their ability to teleport by using an enderpearl on them.

> **Note**
> 
> Shearing uses 1 durability on the shears.
> 
> Shearing does not drop enderpearls or affect the drops of the enderman.
